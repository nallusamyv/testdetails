15+ years of experience designing enterprise-grade data warehouses, marts, and cloud-native analytics platforms (AWS, Snowflake, Databricks) for Fortune 500 firms (JPMC, Cigna, NY Life). Uniquely blend traditional data modeling mastery (star/snowflake schemas, ETL/ODS) with modern AI/LLM automation to accelerate delivery, governance, and business value.

Key Specializations:
ðŸ”¹ Data Warehouse & Mart Design: Proven success in building high-performance, governed warehouses (star/snowflake schemas) and domain-aligned marts for finance, insurance, and healthcare use cases.
ðŸ”¹ Modernization: Migrated legacy warehouses to cloud-native platforms (AWS, Snowflake) with 40% cost savings and 2x faster queries via Parquet/Iceberg optimizations.
ðŸ”¹ AI-Driven Efficiency: Automated 70% of manual modeling tasks via RAG-based metadata pipelines, accelerating mart/warehouse deployment.

Core Competencies
1. Data Warehouse & Mart Design
âœ… End-to-End Architecture:

Designed ODS â†’ warehouse â†’ mart pipelines for 10M+ member healthcare data (Cigna) and 5M+ insurance policies (NY Life).

Implemented star/snowflake schemas with role-based access controls (RBAC) to enforce LOB-specific mart security.
âœ… Performance Optimization:

Architected Snowflake virtual warehouses with dynamic scaling, reducing query latency by 35%.

Migrated NY Lifeâ€™s on-prem SQL Server mart to Snowflake, enabling real-time analytics for actuarial teams.
