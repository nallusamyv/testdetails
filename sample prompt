Column Name|Description|Semantic Logical Column Name|Semantic Logical Description|Similarity Score


Rule #1: Semantic Column Available
If a semantic column is available (i.e., a logical column name and description exist with a vector similarity score), follow these steps:

Extract the Logical Column Name:

Use the logical_column_name from the semantic data as the derived column name.

Example: If the input is customer_name|The name of the customer|0.95, the derived column name will be customer_name.

Validate the Similarity Score:

Check if the vector_db_similarity_score meets a predefined threshold (e.g., > 0.8). If it does, proceed with the derived column name.

If the score is below the threshold, treat it as if no semantic column is available and follow Rule #2.

Output:

Return the derived logical column name and its description.

Rule #2: Semantic Column Not Available
If no semantic column is available or the similarity score is below the threshold, follow a standard naming convention:

Standardize the Column Name:

Convert the input column name to lowercase.

Replace spaces, special characters, or invalid symbols with underscores (_).

Example: Input Column Name â†’ input_column_name.

Generate a Logical Description:

If no description is provided, create a generic description based on the column name.

Example: For input_column_name, the description could be "The value for input_column_name."

Output:

Return the standardized column name and the generated description.
Input:
Column Name: Customer Name

Description: The name of the customer

Semantic Data: customer_name|The name of the customer|0.95

Rule #1 Applied:
Derived Column Name: customer_name

Description: The name of the customer

Output:
Column Name: customer_name

Description: The name of the customer

Input:
Column Name: Sales Data

Description: No description available

Semantic Data: None

Rule #2 Applied:
Standardized Column Name: sales_data

Generated Description: The value for sales_data.

Output:
Column Name: sales_data

Description: The value for sales_data.
