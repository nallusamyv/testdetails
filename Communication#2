Today, we will discuss the Indian Parliament, adjournments, and heated assembly debates. Shall we begin the show? Welcome to The Imperfect Show. Imperfection will never be adjourned. Even if no one is present, the show must go on.

Let’s start with the DMK. The assembly is currently in session. It is known that DMK claimed to fulfill 100% of their manifesto promises. However, part-time teachers have stated that the government did not fulfill its promise to make their jobs permanent. They also mentioned that the previous government did not convert them to permanent positions, and the DMK, which was in opposition at that time, criticized them for it.

The DMK fought against the previous government on this issue, arguing that a salary of ₹12,000 is insufficient to support a family. They further promised that, if elected, all part-time teachers would be made permanent employees.

This promise was listed as the 161st item in their manifesto. Currently, there are 16,000 part-time teachers earning ₹12,000. The DMK claimed they fulfilled 100% of their manifesto promises. While this was listed as the 161st manifesto item, it may have been overlooked. Meanwhile, government teachers have stated they are ready to make the DMK the opposition party in the 2026 elections.

In today’s assembly session, Chief Minister Stalin announced that the birthday of Vavo Vavosi Swaminathan will be celebrated as Tamil Literature Day. Additionally, several debates occurred, especially concerning Adani. The opposition alleged that the U.S. government claimed Tamil Nadu’s electricity board received bribes from Adani to pay higher unit prices for electricity.

The opposition also accused the Chief Minister of meeting with Adani regarding this matter. The CM clarified that he did not meet Adani and called these allegations false. He also stated that the Electricity Minister had already provided a detailed report on Adani’s investments in Tamil Nadu. Furthermore, he emphasized that Adani acted unjustly.

The CM emphasized the need to discuss this matter in a joint parliamentary committee. Both the PMK and BJP also expressed their support for highlighting this issue.
