Hey team, thanks for joining.

In a nutshell, let’s keep it brief on the objectives so we can focus on the big picture of risk as a constellation seal.

I want to touch base on the enhancements needed in the control plane. We need to fast track this effort since more applications are lined up to onboard to Snowflake. Tackling the low-hanging fruit first will help us show quick progress.

We’re aligned on the entitlement with the understanding that access control will be maintained in the Risk database, but we need to streamline the process further.

Let’s focus on the discussion of the pros and cons of using the Risk database as a constellation seal. I’ve outlined the key points for reference.

As for the CCB view on this, we’ll take it offline and circle back later to finalize the approach.
