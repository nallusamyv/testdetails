        I have the following SQL query written in Teradata:

        Purpose of the query: {query_purpose}
        
        Please do the following:
        1. Convert this query to Redshift SQL syntax.
        2. If there are any schema changes needed, here are the schema changes: {schema_str}. If no schema changes are needed, ignore this step.
        3. Generate a suggestion query with the following changes:
           - If the query contains `SELECT *`, replace it with specific columns like column1, column2.
           - If the `2ndpartyflag` is set to true, include `partition_date = 20200101` in the `WHERE` clause.
           - Ensure the suggestion query aligns with Redshift syntax.

        Return the following:
        1. The converted Redshift query.
        2. The suggestion query.
