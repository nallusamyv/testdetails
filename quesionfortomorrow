1. System Design & Architecture

Objective: See if the candidate can design end-to-end systems and reason about trade-offs.

Questions / Scenarios:

Design a vector search system for millions of documents with LLM integration.

Look for: data storage choices, embedding indexing, caching, API layer, scaling.

Build a real-time AI inference pipeline with multiple concurrent users.

Look for: concurrency handling, queueing, batching, Fargate/EC2 deployment.

Architect a multi-service system (microservices) with reliability and observability.

Look for: service decomposition, inter-service communication, monitoring/logging, fault tolerance.

2. Data Engineering & Modeling

Objective: Test their ability to structure, store, and process data efficiently.

Questions / Scenarios:

How would you store embeddings for 100M+ records and allow fast similarity search?

Look for: vector DB selection, persistence, indexing, sharding/partitioning.

Design a schema for analytics data with multiple LOBs and high update volume.

Look for: normalization vs denormalization, partitioning, indexing, masking/security.

How would you validate and maintain metadata in a large enterprise system?

Look for: pipelines, versioning, auditing, error handling.

3. Scaling & Performance

Objective: Assess knowledge of resource management, load handling, and optimization.

Questions / Scenarios:

How would you handle 10k concurrent requests to an AI/vector DB service?

Look for: batching, async processing, auto-scaling, caching, persistent storage.

How do you optimize ECS Fargate tasks for CPU/memory-intensive workloads?

Look for: right-sizing tasks, monitoring, horizontal/vertical scaling, cost/performance trade-offs.

How would you design data pipelines to handle spikes without downtime?

Look for: queue-based ingestion, backpressure handling, fault-tolerant design.

4. Reliability & Fault Tolerance

Objective: Evaluate ability to anticipate failures and design resilient systems.

Questions / Scenarios:

How do you design a service that must be available 24/7 with ECS + vector DB?

Look for: auto-healing, retries, failover, multi-AZ deployment, persistent storage.

How would you recover from corrupted data or failed embeddings in production?

Look for: idempotency, versioning, auditing, retry mechanisms.

How do you monitor and alert on system health for AI/DB workloads?

Look for: metrics (CPU/memory/latency), logs, anomaly detection, dashboards.

5. CI/CD & DevOps Integration

Objective: Check if they can deploy and maintain production-grade systems.

Questions / Scenarios:

How do you deploy ECS tasks for LLM/vector workloads with minimal downtime?

Look for: rolling/canary/blue-green deployments, image versioning, rollback strategy.

How do you manage secrets for multiple services in ECS?

Look for: Secrets Manager, environment injection, least privilege IAM roles.

How do you test a pipeline end-to-end before production?

Look for: unit/integration tests, staging environments, simulated load, monitoring alerts.

6. Problem-Solving & Trade-Off Evaluation

Objective: Understand their engineering mindset—do they reason about trade-offs or just implement?

Questions / Scenarios:

You have limited memory for a vector DB but high query volume—how do you design the system?

Look for: caching, batching, persistent storage, asynchronous processing.

You need low-latency AI responses for 10k concurrent users—what architecture changes?

Look for: distributed compute, GPU tasks, task sharding, retriever optimizations.

You need to maintain metadata audit logs for millions of rows—how do you scale it?

Look for: append-only tables, incremental updates, partitioning, eventual consistency.
